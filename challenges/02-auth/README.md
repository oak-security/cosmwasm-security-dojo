# Challenge 2: auth

This second challenge will depict a common bug that could have critical consequences, this challenge is about...

**Wait :exclamation: Don't you want to try solving it first?** :sunglasses:

Try finding the security vulnerability in the contract in `./src`.

If you are stuck or want to skip to the explanation of the vulnerability of this challenge, please check the [explanation page](EXPLANATION.md) or our blog post [CosmWasm Security Spotlight #2](https://jcsec-audits.medium.com/cosmwasm-security-spotlight-2-3b8abeb066a1).
