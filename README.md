# The CosmWasm Security Dojo :japanese_castle:

Welcome to **[Oak Security](https://oaksecurity.io)'s CosmWasm Security Dojo** :japanese_castle:, where all apprentices studying CosmWasm smart contracts are welcome :cyclone:. This Dojo teaches common security vulnerabilities in CosmWasm smart contracts.

## First time here?

The challenges that we will be publishing here target a **beginner audience** and could be categorized between easy and medium difficulty. It is the perfect place to start honing your security skills if you are looking to develop **secure CosmWasm smart contracts** or, if you are into security but new to this awesome tech, to **spot common pitfalls** on CosmWasm smart contracts.

To successfully face the challenges you should get familiar with Rust and CosmWasm smart contracts first. There are plenty of resources out there, but the below is a good starting point:

- [Rust by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html)
- [The CosmWasm Book](https://book.cosmwasm.com/)
- [CosmWasm Academy](https://cosmwasm.getlearnworlds.com/)

## Challenges and topics

For now please consider this repo as a work in progress :construction:, as we will be adding new challenges over the next weeks.

Each challenge includes a working proof of concept (PoC) along with other functional tests. You can find the PoC it under `tests/exploit.rs`, but we encourage you to try to craft the exploit yourself first. The experience gained from trying to find the bug and crafting the PoC on your own will make a big difference in your learning journey.

The current set of challenges is listed below:

1. [Store-what?](/challenges/01-storewhat)
2. [Auth](/challenges/02-auth)
3. [Mint](/challenges/03-mint)
4. [NFT state](/challenges/04-nft)
5. [Addressing](/challenges/05-addressing)
